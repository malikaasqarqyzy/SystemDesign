# Decentralized Humanitarian Aid Distribution System (D-HADS)

## Overview
D-HADS is a decentralized system designed to manage and track humanitarian aid distribution fairly and transparently, even in offline environments. The system uses biometric identification and blockchain technology to ensure unique recipient registration, prevent aid duplication, and maintain trust without central control.

## Key Features
- Offline-first architecture with local-first data storage
- Biometric registration with privacy-preserving features
- Decentralized identity management
- Blockchain-based aid distribution tracking
- Cross-organization aid coordination
- Data synchronization when connectivity is available
- Self-sovereign identity for recipients

## Architecture

### 1. Identity Management
- Biometric capture and template creation (fingerprints, iris scans)
- Privacy-preserving biometric template storage
- Decentralized identifiers (DIDs) generation
- QR code generation for quick identification

### 2. Local Node Architecture
- Offline-capable mobile/tablet applications
- Local database for storing recipient data and aid distribution records
- Local blockchain node for transaction validation
- Mesh networking capabilities for node-to-node communication

### 3. Synchronization Layer
- Eventual consistency model
- Conflict resolution mechanisms
- Merkle tree-based data verification
- Peer-to-peer synchronization protocol

### 4. Aid Distribution Tracking
- Smart contracts for aid program rules
- Transparent distribution records
- Multi-signature verification for aid delivery
- Audit trail generation

### 5. Privacy & Security
- Zero-knowledge proofs for identity verification
- Encrypted data storage
- Key management system
- Data access control

## Technical Stack
- Backend: Rust (for performance and safety)
- Mobile App: Flutter (cross-platform support)
- Database: CouchDB (offline-first, sync capabilities)
- Blockchain: Substrate framework (customizable blockchain)
- Biometrics: OpenMBee (open-source biometric library)
- Mesh Network: LibP2P

## Deployment Requirements
- Android/iOS tablets or smartphones
- Optional: Dedicated biometric scanners
- Local server hardware for larger operations
- Power banks and solar chargers

## Security Considerations
1. Biometric data never leaves the local device
2. All data is encrypted at rest
3. Zero-knowledge proofs for identity verification
4. Multi-factor authentication for aid workers
5. Audit logs are immutable and distributed

## Data Synchronization
1. Local-first data storage
2. Peer-to-peer synchronization when nodes meet
3. Conflict resolution using vector clocks
4. Merkle tree verification for data integrity
5. Bandwidth-efficient delta synchronization

## Trust Model
- Decentralized consensus through blockchain
- Multi-stakeholder validation
- Transparent audit trails
- Cross-organization verification
- Community-driven governance
